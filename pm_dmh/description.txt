[green]This is a custom version that is compatible with ProMods.[normal]

This mod repaints colors on the road map, and removes all the icons, road numbers and company logos to help with exploring all roads.

[orange]Notes:[normal]

* Put the mod at the top of the mod loading order, even above Promods itself.
* Unless there is a bug directly with the world map view, it is most likely a bug with ProMods.
