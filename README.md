# Discovery Map Helper for ProMods
This is a variant of [Discovery Map Helper](https://github.com/Art-Stea1th/DiscoveryMapHelper) that is compatible with ProMods. It is a mod that repaints colors on the road map and removes all the icons, road numbers and company logos to help with exploring all roads.

## Installation:
* Download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/rasmusolle/DiscoveryMapHelper-Promods/releases) and move the downloaded file into your "My Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\mod" folder.
* Select your profile, click the "Mod manager" button and enable the mod.

## Notes:
* Put the mod at the top of the mod loading order, even above Promods itself.
* Unless there is a bug directly with the world map view, it is most likely a bug with ProMods.
